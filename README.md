FridgeBuddy is a project where we aim to reduce food wastage in the university. The project would do this by helping both staff and students monitor the contents of the Community Fridge. This will also include statistics about the Community Fridge usage to reduce even more food waste within the University.

We have developed two different applications for this software project:

# FridgeBuddy Tablet App (Android)
- This application will be displayed on a tablet which will be placed at the Community Fridge. FridgeBuddy users (Students or Staff) will be able to update the quantities for each item once they retrieve something from the physical fridge. Once the changes have been made on the FridgeBuddy Tablet App, these will be shown in the FridgeBUddy Mobile App, where users will be able to see the items available in the fridge in real time.

- The main FridgeBuddy Administrator will be able to add other Community Fridge Volunteers so they can become part of the FridgeBuddy Admins. These will be able to Log-In with their Google or Facebook account or with their phone number if preferred. FridgeBuddy Admins will also be able to add items on the FridgeBuddy Tablet App if they want to add something to the physical fridge. They can view, update or add items to the fridge which will then be shown in the FridgeBuddy Mobile app in real time.

# FridgeBuddy Mobile App (Android & iOS)
- This application is intended to be used by FridgeBuddy users (Students or Staff). FridgeBuddy users will not reqruire any form of Log-In. These will be able to view the items which are held in the Community Fridge in real time. They will have various options to filter their results and view those specific items from the fridge. E.g. View items only in Bowland Community Fridge & donated only by GoBurrito. They will also have the option to add items to their favourties list and enable notifications for it. E.g. If I add "Sausage rolls" in my favourties list, I will be able to enable notifications for it and everytime there is Sausage rolls available in the Community Fridge, I will get a notification. You can also enable general notifications for when new food items have been added to the Community Fridge.
